# regenwall
You ever just get tired of phone wallpapers?

Some people (like me) like changing things up every now and then. That's normal. But even AI wallpaper generators have a process attached to them. You typically have to go to two different apps: one for the image, and your settings to set it as your wallpaper.

Introducing RegenWall. (pronounced "re-GION-whal", if you're me, and "reh-gen-WAHL" if you're my dad.) Shake up your wallpaper with locally generated images, customizable to your taste. It's one of the most customizable generators available today. It doesn't use AI-- every button is mapped to definite math.

And the best part? It's FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software). Even better than free, because you can go through the code yourself.

**Forget boring. Regen your wall.**

# v1 -- highlights
* **Initial release!** Always a fun time.
* Local Perlin Noise generator
* Fully customizable
* ... works
**RegenWall is still a prerelease! v1 coming soon, I promise :)**

# downloading
1. Go to "Releases" tab
2. Find the latest release
3. Scroll down to regenwall.apk and click that link to download
4. Open your file explorer and click on the newly downloaded app to install
It's not complicated.

... until it gets complicated.  
You may need to allow an app to install from an external source in Settings. Usually that's under something like Settings > Apps > the app. For installing this, you most likely want to use your file browser to install, so select your file browser from the list of apps and find the "allow external installs" toggle.

# and using
1. Give it an open! You'll see a list of buttons. These are all the generators you can use. Select a generator you think you'll like.  
(As of v1: there's only one generator. I'm working on more, I promise :D)
2. Customize away! Inside the generator page, you'll find settings galore for editing almost every possible configuration. If it looks complicated, don't worry! I recommend starting with the Flow Field generator, and setting "particle count" to 500 and "particle speed" to .35.
3. Hit generate! A progress bar will let you know where it's at.  
Some generators (v1: the one generator) might take longer if you max certain settings (v1: the particle count). "for" loops do take some time :)
4. It'll display the generated wallpaper. If you like it, hit save, and that's your wallpaper! It'll also save it to a folder in your Pictures directory, if you want to do something else with it.
That's it!

**help wanted**

No joke, building an Android app is a long, complicated process that takes a lot of effort (if you're me and you wrote this on a flip phone with a keyboard plugged in). In short: if you want to help, fork the repo and create a PR when you're ready. There's lots of things I haven't gotten around to and need to.
